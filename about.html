        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my blog about the craft of software development, coding and including some career advice.
            I've been developing full-time for about 8 years, the last 5 years as a freelancer, though I created my
            first websites (with Perl!) in 1998. I've built a couple of side businesses, one of them is profitable
            (a niche jobboard), but my time is mostly spent as a freelance developer / software architect / consultant.
        </p>
        <p>
            I live in Germany and my stack has included PHP (plain, Laravel, Symfony),
            JavaScript (jQuery, Vue.js, Angular, TypeScript), Python (Flask and hopefully soon Django), Docker, AWS
            and some other buzzwords. I mostly worked with very small to medium-sized companies, sometimes at
            their office, sometimes remote or in my home office.
        </p>

        <h2>Blog</h2>
        <p>
            This blog started »by hand«, i.e. I didn't use a generator a backend programming language or
            a JavaScript framework, but rather just some plain html and some styles and a font or two. I was
            thinking of using Hugo, or Jekyll, or even Next.js or maybe even something exotic. But in
            the end, I wanted something hassle-free.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, there will be copy-and-pasting involved, but that just motivates me to think things through
            before I add something new :-). And to be strategic about changes.
